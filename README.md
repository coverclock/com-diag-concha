# Abstract

This file is part of the Digital Aggregates Corporation Concha package.
Concha illustrates how to exploit abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance,
and polymorphism in ANSI C. The ideas behind Concha are based on work the
author did for one of the Corporation's clients, but is a fully clean
room reimplementation and is in fact completely incompatible with that
prior commercial intellectual property.

This software is an original work of its authors.
